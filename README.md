# C3plus v0.1
Combined Calibration and Characterization by Parameter Optimization

### Status

The project is in early development and will at some point contain all of the functionality promised by its title. This is a release candidate for version 0.1 which is able to provide a calibration routine for a  specific operation on a quantum device.

### Roadmap
v0.1: Calibration
v0.2: Simulation
...
v1.0: Learning the model

### User guide

For now, please look to the jupyter notebook in the example folder for instructions on how to use this package. Proper documentation is coming.

### Developer installation

If you don't want to reinstall the package each time after cloning from the repository, install it with

pip install -e \<source directory\>

or similar, depending on your python environment. Adding the -e specifies the developer option and will only link to the source.
