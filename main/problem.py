class System:
    """
    Abstraction of system in terms of the parts that compose it, e.g. two qubits and a cavity.
    (registers, device specs), this is what the experimentalist tells you.
    It constructs models for the system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    :param components:
    :param connection:
    :param phys_params:

    Methods
    -------
    construct_model(system_parameters, numerical_parameters)
        Construct a model for this system, to be used in numerics.
    get_parameters()
        Produces a dict of physical system parameters
    """

class Model:
    """
    What the theorist thinks about from the system.
    Class to store information about our system/problem/device. Different models can represent the same system.

    Parameters
    ---------
    physical_parameters : dict
        Represents the beta in GOAT language. Contains physical parameters as well as Hilbert space dimensions, bounds
    numerical_parameters : dict
        Hilbert space dimensions of computational and full spaces

    Attributes
    ----------
    H: :class:'qutip.qobj' System hamiltonian or a list of Drift and Control terms
    H_tf : empty, constructed when needed

    Methods
    -------
    construct_Hamiltonian(system_parameters, numerical_parameters)
        Construct a model for this system, to be used in numerics.
    get_Hamiltonian()
        Returns the Hamiltonian in a QuTip compatible way

class Problem:
    """
    Main Class. CLass to specify the problem that we are trying to solve.

    Parameters
    ---------
    goal_func:
        maybe string/handles
    gates_to_optimize:
        as string/handles or abstract objects
    system:
        If you want to learn the model for this system.
    initial_model:
        (optional) Can be constructed from system or given directly.
    simulation_backend:
        Provides measurement results from simulated dynamics.
    experiment_backend:
        Calls the actual physical system (or simulation thereof) that you want to learn and that we will do the calibration on.

        Contains the search algorithm and infrastructure

    Attributes
    ----------
    optimal_pulses:
        Correspond to the gates_to_optimize
