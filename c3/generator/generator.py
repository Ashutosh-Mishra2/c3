Signal generation stack.

Contrary to most quanutm simulators, C^3 includes a detailed simulation of the control
stack. Each component in the stack and its functions are simulated individually and
combined here.

Example: A local oscillator and arbitrary waveform generator signal
are put through via a mixer device to produce an effective modulated signal.
